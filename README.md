# Automation of API tests using Postman platform

This is my first API testing project. It was made in Postman using [Chai Assertion Library](https://www.chaijs.com/).

## Project info

Project Skeleton was made by Daniel Avellaneda. Find it [here](https://github.com/davellanedam/vue-skeleton-mvp), where you can see more information about it.

The server was running locally, so it is available on localhost:3000. Communication between API requests goes over environment variables.

Find API documentation in this Github folder.
